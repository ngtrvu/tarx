user: [Telegram Vu Nguyen (@ngtrvu) id:524134856 +32s 2026-02-02 17:41 UTC] I'm done the first attemp with very low security. Now let do the check up
[message_id: 40]
assistant: Good call on tightening things up. Let me run a quick security audit:
assistant: **🔐 Security Checkup**

**Issues Found:**

1. **⚠️ Gateway password in config file**
   - Password `xxxxxx` is stored in plaintext in `openclaw.json`
   - Fix: Use env var `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` instead

2. **⚠️ Telegram bot token in config**
   - Token visible in plaintext
   - Fix: Use env var `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

3. **⚠️ Gateway bound to 0.0.0.0:18789**
   - Listening on all interfaces (not just localhost)
   - If this server is public-facing, port 18789 is exposed

**What's Good:**
- ✅ Config file permissions: `-rw-------` (600) - owner only
- ✅ Credentials dir: `drwx------` (700) - protected
- ✅ DM policy: allowlist (only your ID can message)
- ✅ Group policy: allowlist
- ✅ Auth mode: password required

**Recommendations:**

1. Move secrets to environment variables (systemd service file or `.env`)
2. Check if port 18789 needs firewall rules (`ufw status` or cloud security groups)
3. Consider enabling Tailscale for secure remote access instead of LAN bind

Want me to help migrate the secrets to env vars?
user: [Telegram Vu Nguyen (@ngtrvu) id:524134856 +40s 2026-02-02 17:42 UTC] okay, can you make it to it?
[message_id: 43]
assistant: Found it - user systemd service. Let me check and update:
assistant: Good, now let me:
1. Add the secrets as environment variables
2. Remove them from the config file
user: [Telegram Vu Nguyen (@ngtrvu) id:524134856 +52s 2026-02-02 17:44 UTC] try to restart the gateway by "openclaw gateway restart"
[message_id: 47]
user: [Telegram Vu Nguyen (@ngtrvu) id:524134856 +42s 2026-02-02 17:45 UTC] are you still there?
[message_id: 48]
assistant: Yeah, I'm here! The restart command timed out waiting for response - that's expected since restarting kills my connection temporarily.

Let me check if it came back up:
assistant: Gateway's running (new PID 47489). 

Now let me update the config to remove the plaintext secrets and reload:
assistant: Good, the systemd service has the env vars. Now let me remove them from the config file:
assistant: Hmm, the config.patch merged but didn't remove the existing secrets (patch adds, doesn't delete). Let me edit the config file directly:
